# AGENTS.md (agent-wide workspace instructions)

These instructions apply to AI agents working in this repository.

- If you are generating prompts, follow APS v1.0 conventions.
- Never modify files under `references/` unless explicitly asked to publish a spec revision.
- Default to planning first; only apply edits after presenting a plan.
